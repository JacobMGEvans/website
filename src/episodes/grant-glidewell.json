  "description": "In this episode of Second Career Devs, I chat with Grant Glidewell, a JavaScript developer for Zesty.io, about his previous career as a substance abuse counselor for teens. Having struggled with substance abuse issues as young person, Grant knew precisely what he wanted to do for work: help others the way he needed help. We learn lessons from Grant about moving forward when the work you love isn't a viable option anymore.",
